Validate On Save
================

Hey! Remember:

  1. Saving.
  2. Switching to your browser (or attempting to compile/run).
  3. Refreshing.
  4. Finding out you had a syntax error in your source code.
  5. Switching back to TextMate.
  6. Fixing the error.
  7. Saving.
  8. Switching back to the browser.
  9. Refreshing?

This bundle lets you skips several of those steps.


Supported Languages
-------------------

  * CoffeeScript
  * CSS
  * Erlang (possibly buggy, compiles *.beam file using erlc)
  * Haml
  * JavaScript
  * JSON
  * Perl
  * PHP
  * Python (using PyFlakes)
  * Ruby
  * Sass/Compass (still a bit buggy)


Installation
------------

Follow these instructions if you have Git installed:
    
    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/; #just in case you are missing the folder
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/;
    git clone git://github.com/sxtxixtxcxh/validate-on-save.tmbundle.git "Validate On Save.tmbundle";
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles';
    
Installing via Git will allow you to keep up to date with the `Bundles` > `Validate On Save` > `Update Bundle` menu command.

If you don't have Git and downloaded this from Github (really? you don't have Git?), after you've unzipped or untarred, you'll have to rename the folder from `sxtxixtxcxh-validate-on-save.tmbundle-#{HASH}` to `Validate On Save.tmbundle`. Double click and TextMate should install it for you.


Configuration
-------------

### The `VOS_` Options:

You can customize how and when VOS (Validate On Save) notifies you. This is done by setting Shell Variables in TextMate (`Textmate` > `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `Shell Variables`). All variables starting with `VOS_` take values of either "true" or "false".

  * `VOS_VALIDATOR_INFO`: Outputs information about the validator. (defaults to "false")
  * `VOS_ONLY_ON_ERROR`: Only displays notifications on syntax error. Useful if you don't want to be told repeatedly that everything is OK. (defaults to "false")
  * `VOS_TM_NOTIFY`: Display the validation result in a TextMate tooltip. If you use Growl, you might want to disable this. (defaults to "true")
  * `VOS_GROWL`: Use Growl to display the validation result. (defaults to "false")
  * `VOS_JUMP_TO_ERROR`: When a error is found, automatically move the cursor to the line causing the problem. (defaults to "false")
  * `VOS_ERL_OUTPUT_TO_TMP`: When validating Erlang, the `.erl` file you are working on needs to be compiled to a `.beam` file to look for any syntax errors. By default when VOS compiles your file, it outputs the resulting compiled beam file to `/tmp` after which it removes it. Set this to false to have the beam file be outout to the same directory as the `.erl` file you are working on. (defaults to "false")
  * `VOS_CSS_PROFILE`: When to validate css against a specific profile. See [CSS Validator sommand settings][w3ccss] for a list of valid profiles. (defaults to 2.1)
  
### Binary Path Options:

These options are used to specify the full path to the executable binaries for the different commands VOS relies upon. With the exception of `TM_GROWLNOTIFY`, `TM_RUBY`, `TM_COFFEESCRIPT` and `TM_ERB`, all of these must be specified for their corresponding validator to work.

  * `TM_COFFEESCRIPT`
  * `TM_COMPASS`
  * `TM_ERB`
  * `TM_ERLC`
  * `TM_GROWLNOTIFY`
  * `TM_HAML`
  * `TM_PERL`
  * `TM_PYFLAKES`
  * `TM_RUBY`/`TM_VOS_RUBY`
  * `TM_SASS`

### Regarding `TM_SASS` and `TM_COMPASS`:

If `TM_COMPASS` is set to "false", validation is done using the standard Sass binary.

### Regarding `TM_RUBY` and `TM_VOS_RUBY`:

`TM_VOS_RUBY` takes priority over `TM_RUBY` and is useful in the cases that you
want TextMate to use a different Ruby or Ruby wrapper for validation vs. testing as `TM_VOS_RUBY` is always run with `-w`.

### Regarding `env: ... No such file or directory`

If you haven't already done so, make sure your TextMate `PATH` shell variable includes `/usr/local/bin`.

Updating
--------

If you installed via the recommended method above by running `git clone...`, you can easily update the bundle via `Bundles` > `Validate On Save` > `Update Bundle`.


Caveats
-------

This is a very early release, so it *might* not work out so well for you. Feel free to let me know at [sxtxixtxcxh@gmail.com][1] or [on twitter][2].

### Compass Validation

The Compass "validation" actually compiles your SASS files and returns any errors or warnings.

If you are using a standalone Compass project, it depends on being able to find your `config.rb` file in either the same directory as your SASS files *or* in one any of the parent directories.

If you're using Compass with Rails it runs `compass --update` on your Rails root directory, as determined by the parent of the `app` or `public` directory. This means your SASS files must be descendants of one of those directories. Compass, by default, installs into `#{RAILS_ROOT}/app/stylesheets/`.

### CSS Validation

CSS validation is done locally using w3c.org's Jigsaw server. This means it's essentially booting up a java based web server, so it can be relatively slow.

### JSON Validation

JSON validation is done using `jsonlint`, which is installable through the Node Package manager `npm`. For installation details, see [jsonlint](https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint).
